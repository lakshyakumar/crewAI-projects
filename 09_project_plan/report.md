### Summary and Rationale for Allocation

1. **Bob Smith (Designer)** is allocated to the design-focused tasks (UI Design, Responsive Design) early in the timeline as these are critical for the visual and functional foundation of the website. He also co-leads the "About Us" and "Services" pages, maximizing his design expertise.

2. **Jane Doe (Software Engineer)** is allocated to user navigation and development-focused tasks. After Bob's UI work, she implements the navigation and develops content pages ("About Us" & "Services"), leading further page developments and optimizations aligning with her technical skills.

3. **Alice Johnson and Tom Brown (QA Engineers)** are assigned to Quality Assurance and Testing in Week 8 & 9 to ensure the final product meets the required standards before launch. Having two QA Engineers ensures thorough usability and functionality testing.

4. **John Doe (Project Manager)** oversees the final review and launch in Week 10, ensuring all tasks are completed and align with project goals.

This allocation ensures that tasks are aligned with each team member's expertise while also distributing the workload effectively to prevent overburdening. This strategic distribution also considers task dependencies and timelines, promoting seamless transitions between phases and ultimately enhancing project efficiency and success.
